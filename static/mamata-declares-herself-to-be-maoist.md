I am sure most of you who is reading this post already know what happened on 14th August.  
  
14th August night at 07:00 P.M IST aitmc.org (the official website of All India Trinamul Congress) was hacked (Wait I didn't say by who/whom).  
  
On Aitmc's site there is a place where the chairperson (Mamata Banerjee) expresses her views. On 14th night a new message appeared from the CM which went like below.  
  

> "I AM A MAOIST at heart and always have been, It always pained me to speak and act against the ideology that I myself loved so much. I also appologize to the people whom I have hurt, The artist who tried to speak the truth, the writers who saw the right thing and every and any person who tried to tell me I was going in the wrong direction, I am at your feet asking you to forgive me for the misguided acts I have done In life_"_

Well there were more but you get the point. The full statement can be seen in the below screenshot

And as usual everyone jumped over on it and for obvious reasons everyone thought Anonymous did this. And the below tweet didn't help either

And most of the news and media I have seen till now have proudly linked them to it.

The only problem is that the hack was not performed by Anon India. Instead it was done by one of their friend @TeamVOID who informed Anon india first of it.

  

And Anon India has tried to convey it several times too

And on top of that several media has started stating that Anonymous is a Maoist Group :P Prompting them to start the [#**StopPaidMedia**](https://twitter.com/search/?q=%23StopPaidMedia&src=hash)campaign :)
