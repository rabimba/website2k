So finally we have BBM for our Android and iOS devices.  
Well done BlackBerry!  
  
But then again you are stuck in the waiting list and losing your patience waiting fro that sweet invite.  
Well I see a lot of my friends in my friend-list getting stuck at that phase and even after more than 36 hours of the release I still see them getting nowhere.  
Hence I thought of giving them a heads up.  
  
Fortunately I myself didn't have to wait a single moment for the BBM invite. Actually i got the invite before I even installed the app, all courtesy to my friend in BlackBerry (yeah you deserve a "Biriyani" :D )  
  
But for those who are still waiting. Try this neat little trick.  
This worked on a few mobiles I tried here. But be warned due to the nature of the trick this may stop working anytime.  
  
  

1.  Install the BBM app, launch it, and then register your email address to join the waiting list.
2.  Return to your home screen and **force close** the app.
3.  Relaunch the BBM app. You should now be able to create a new BBM account.

Remember the "_Force Close_" is the key to the whole thing.

  

So Happy Messaging!
