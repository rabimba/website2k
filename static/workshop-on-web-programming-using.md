I will be conducting a workshop on Web Programming using JavaScript on UTDallas on October 6th. Everyone is invited to participate.  
  
Registrations are taken at [UTD Marketplace](https://ezpay.utdallas.edu/C20239_ustores/web/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCTID=1085).  
  
I will be covering basic JavaScript along with jQuery. You can get a detailed overview about what is in store from [UTD Event Comet Calender](http://www.utdallas.edu/calendar/event.php?id=1220354471).  
  
But If we find participants with interest then I might go to some more depth including some very interesting examples and hands-on.
