Yesterday marked the last day of Infocom 11 in Kolkata.It was quite a nice experience this time being there with Bibhas,Kuntal and the most fun part was the Kolkata Bloggers meet yesterday.

Anyway…the event was scheduled to start at 5:30 but finally it started at 6. It was a nice crowd…not too many people…but enough to fill the seats. We had to register ourselves for the event and they asked for our blog links too (that’s why I’m hoping this post of mine will find some audience at-least).

  

First the inauguration speech was by the greatbong (Arnab Roy) with his usual sense of humor and brilliant lecture. He mentioned how people like to think µ-blogging (twitter) is killing the old style blogging and why he doesn’t think likewise. Overall it was an interesting speech.

  

Next one by one we heard talks about how media is following this social media burst,how they are trying to cope with the twitter and its direct news integration. We were exposed to persons having experience in  using these social services to make commercial moves,financial gains.

  

And of course after that a presentation by R.Bharadwaj about start blogging today (yeah we all knew that).

  

While the event kicked off fine but it got boring and later a bit confusing too as people started getting on dias and telling things like”SEO is an over-hyped concept” and that too the person whose startupcreated the product for data mining from social media.

Well at least I had Bibhas,Rahul with me and we enjoyed quite much (and Kuntal with his camera and twiting).

  

The bright side of the event was got to meet with a lot of like minded people and go tto know how people are coming up with new ideas so fast. It actually inspired me to get my old plan into action!!

  

God these events are wonderful. Do hope to attend some more. (and will thanks to Bibhas though)
