APRIL FOOL!!!  
  
  

![](http://www.allgraphics123.com/ag/01/6472/6472.gif)

  

  
Yes that is the spirit of the day. Everybody tries to fool you today (and you try likewise). My day too started with my mother fooling me :(  
And then of course I got into action :) After a few pranks I logged onto the net too see what Google had in store for us, like it every year had on April Fool's day. And i was not disappointed.  
  
Gmail had a new _revolutionary_ product for us. **Gmail Motion!!**  
  
See the video here:  
  
  
  
Gmail product manager Paul McDonald, in a deadpan explanatory video, said Gmail Motion uses a "language of movements that replaces type entirely" and ends reliance on "outdated technologies" like the keyboard and mouse.  
  
Of course let me clarify. If you don't already know...YEAH this is the Google way to april fool us. :D  
Just the prank I was waiting for. If you still haven't seen it go [here](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/motion.html)  
  
But though this was the hugely popular and shared link of Google's April fool. I _googled_ a bit and found a few more similar pranks by Google itself :P  
Looks like even in the April fool arena there is compitition within google and Gmail Motion won the King's Throne to be the April fool prank.  
Nevertheless The other pranks are quite as good.

**First on the list is**

**Next on the list is from Google Jobs!! :P Want a job in Google? This might just be the job you want :D**  
  
So what precisely is it? It's very simple. Remember that Google instant search? Yeah this is a job to be "Autocompleter". Meaning you get to guess what people are gonna search and have to provide that instant search. In their words

The less I say about this is better. :P  
You should all just see this video to understand what it is :P  
  
  
  
The original link can be found in: [Google Cow](http://www.goo.gl/cow)  
  
  
**Another new entry. Google translator for Animals :P**  
  
This is Google uk production.  
  

[![](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/landing/translateforanimals/infographic-sm.png)](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/landing/translateforanimals/infographic-sm.png)

  

I think you can get the basic idea from the image.

Now this one is an Android App!! And it is actually available to download via this barcode (my android friends point your camera this way)  

[![](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/landing/translateforanimals/qr-sm.png)](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/landing/translateforanimals/qr-sm.png)

In their words 

  

> We are excited to introduce Translate for Animals, an Android application which we hope will allow us to better understand our animal friends. We've always been a pet-friendly company at Google, and we hope that Translate for Animals encourages greater interaction and understanding between animal and human.  
> Translate for Animals is an application for Android phones that recognises and transcribes words and phrases that are common to a species, like cats for example.

Now the second-last and the most enchanting one: **Google Teleportation** :P  
  

[![](http://www.google.cn/intl/zh-CN/landing/teleport/images/gsan-teleport.png)](http://www.google.cn/intl/zh-CN/landing/teleport/images/gsan-teleport.png)

  

  
Now this one is from Google china and the whole page is in chinese (and yeah the Google instant translator won't work here.)  
So what this one is supposed to do?  
Well that part is quite astonishing. In google's word:  

>   
> Through the search is to let Google take you through time and space, most want to reach your arrival time, place, with an immersive way to perceive everything you want to perceive. For example:  
> 
> *   Would like to know beauty tips to lose weight?
>  Today, any search engine on the planet can not give you accurate answers. Please use the Google search through! When you personally through the heroes, beauty, sword, horse of the late Spring and Autumn, you have the opportunity to see the beauty of true tolerance, when she ask for thin Cheats!

Now when you search something...anything then you arrive at an ajax enhanced page with many things along with this recommendation :P  
  
  

> Dressed in the crossing before the guarantee clean, glossy hair, and make sure you have that may be encountered on this through all the fantasy or not the result of fantasy are mentally prepared.Now, to start thinking Macross transfer function, Make sure you follow the action under the figure of four beats, earnestly to do gymnastics again through Google:

You can see the original link here : [Google Teleport](http://www.google.cn/intl/zh-CN/landing/teleport/)  
Now the last one :)  
Google is playing with the world's love of Helvetica and [hate of Comic Sans](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123992364819927171.html) fonts. (I'm generalizing and editorializing here.) [If you search for "Helvetica" in Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=helvetica&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a), the results show up in Comic Sans. OK, maybe not everyone will find that as hilarious as those of us who've worked in typography will, but maybe it'll at least make your eyeballs smile this morning.  
  
Google is renowned for its April Fool's jokes, which over the years have included job applications for positions on the Moon and the revelation that its Internet search rankings are compiled by pigeons.  

  

And these things certainly made my day (partially).  
  

These are all I could find today. if any of you encountered any more pranks by google made for 2011 April Fool, don't forget to leave a comment here :)  

  
_Edit:_ Just included a new prank i just found out.
