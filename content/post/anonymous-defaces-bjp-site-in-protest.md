A day after messing with servers maintained by Reliance Communications, Anonymous, an international hacker collective, defaced two websites belonging to BJP on Sunday. Through its Twitter account (@opindia\_back) it announced that[www.mumbaibjp.org](http://www.mumbaibjp.org/) and[www.bjpmp.org.in](http://www.bjpmp.org.in/) were hacked by the group. After the hacking, the group posted a message to web users, asking them to organize protests against "web censorship" in India on June 9.  
  
While the message was displayed on the homepage of [www.mumbaibjp.org](http://www.mumbaibjp.org/), on[www.bjpmp.org.in](http://www.bjpmp.org.in/) it was inserted as a page at [bjpmp.org.in/ads/anon.html](http://bjpmp.org.in/ads/anon.html). On Mumbai BJP website the message was accompanied by a catchy tune embedded through a YouTube link.  
  
"Today they took away your right to use a few websites... day after tomorrow they will take away your freedom of speech and no one will be there to speak for you. Speak Now or Never," the message read. The hackers said that people should print out or buy Guy Fawkes Masks and wear them while protesting against web censorship in Bangalore, Mangalore, Kochi, Chennai, Vizag, Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad on June 9.
