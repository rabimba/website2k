From left Mitropam,Me and Ananyo. These are the closest friends I have. A feeling of nostalgia is engrossing me. Don't know why. I'm gonna leave for silchar tomorrow, a trip of a week with my family. But just before parting with these tonight caused quite a stir in me. I'm not a emotinal creature by nature. But tonight felt different. Mitul already started for chennai and in a year or two both me and anayo will wither away somewhere else. I know this, have always known this still...  
  
:) Curiosly enough nobody except Âµ till date has been able to stir such emotional diasaster in me. I thought only she was the queen in this.  
  
  
Anyway...enough of this. Its already 11:53. I have to uplaod a lot of pics, Pack my bag and do a lot of unnecessary things I know I'm not remotely interested to do. Still i know I will do.  
  
Thinking when I'll go back to Kol. MAybe 11th...That Microsoft Seminar I've been invited too.  
Then juudging who I am and what lazy but i have :P Myabe i'll just skip.  
  
Astalavista everybody.
