Now this is I recently came across with.  
Its quite interesting :)  
  
Do tell me what you think of this.  
  

Seems like Google chrome’s popularity has disturbed the _[samadhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam%C4%81dhi)_ of [Baba Ramdev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Ramdev) or is it a brainchild of his marketing team… ;)
