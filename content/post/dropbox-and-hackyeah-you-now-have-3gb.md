Among the various cloud storage provider I like Dropbox for its drop-dead simpleness. Even more than what Box.net supports. And I use it for many purposes.  
It has a free2GB scheme with a very competitive pricing. But even then how would it be to get some space free!!  
  

Dropbox is without a doubt the most popular online file storage and desktop syncing solution. By default, users get 2GB of free space when they sign up for a Dropbox account. Considering the popularity and usefulness of Dropbox, I am pretty sure everyone here would wants to increase their storage space for free, if possible. The Dropbox referral system is a nice way of increasing your storage space for free, but the problem is that in this age and time nearly everyone owns a Dropbox account.

Last year, HTC announced that it would be offering up to 5GB of free space on Dropbox with its Sense 3.5 based handsets. This year, the company announced that it would be offering a whopping 25GB of free storage space on Dropbox for 2 years with its One series of handsets. So yeah, if you own a Sense 3.5/4.0 based phone from HTC, chances are you have more than enough free space on your Dropbox account.

Now, one XDA member – [theos0o](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1511381) – has modified the Dropbox APK file that ships with Sense 3.5 handsets. The modified APK file is tricked into identifying non-HTC Android handsets as an HTC branded one, which then increases your Dropbox account storage space by 3GB **for 12 months**. Yeah, that last bit is a bit saddening, but even then 3GB of free space on Dropbox for 12 months for free is pretty damn useful.

So what are you waiting for? The modified Dropbox APK file can be downloaded from [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?15msg5ur36cwe39). If you already have the Dropbox app installed on your handset, un-install it, and install the modified APK and sign in. You Dropbox account will then automatically get credited with the free 3GB of storage space. When done, you can uninstall the modified Dropbox APK file and install the latest version from the Android Market again.
