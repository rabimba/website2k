The last saturday I happened to attend the Wikipedia kolkata meet-up. I've been contributing (in whatever small articles I can) to Wikipedia for a long time and gaining from it from a much longer time :P  
  
But this is the first time I got to attend such a meet-up. Wikipedia/Wiki-media Kolkata 3rd meet up was held on Saturday 12th February, 2011 at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, Kolkata. It was a get-together of wikipedians /wikimedians (contributors and users) by meeting up, discussing, sharing experiences, reaching out and advocacy for Wikipedia and wiki-media.  
  
The event started by a introductory lecture by Mr. Jayanta Nath along with a very very interesting presentation (I must see the person who came up with THAT presentation idea). After that we were addressed by Ms. Rimi B Chatterjee(See the pic, and you can see my back too :P).

Though I don't exactly subscribe to all of her points it was an interesting talk nevertheless. Then came Mr. Sumit Ray. And I must say he is an interesting guy. He has a very curious way to grab his audiences attention (along with his look)

And he supposedly teaches too with his site univbrands.com (interesting site too). Though what he said was contradictory too it was layered with his charm of course.Though he mostly focused on how these brands like wikipedia,google are public created brands and how they are different,how they can sustain it was a good talk.  
  
After that we were in for a live video conferencing from Mr. Liam Wyat from Australia. And though the video conferencing was a disaster it finally took place thanks to our google talk. Seriously I've never seen a more buggy V.conferencing using skype. Even in G.talk they had problem setting up the mic in this side so what the conference became was a one way talk and all of us responding via chat from this side.  
  
You can actually see them struggling in this pic

The thing we missed sincerely was some tech-talk but I think that was not the purpose of this meet to begin with. After that session came a little workshop and experience sharing and a group picture of all of us attending the workshop..  
  
Here it is
