I just found out this story. And keeping in mind how only one site is sharing this thought of sharing it through my blog.

  

Go through the post. And do give your views about it.

  

Anonymous Operation India (AnonOps India) has accused Reliance (Communications) of going beyond the mandate given to it by courts and the government and blocking sites without authorization. In an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) based press conference hosted at anonops.com, anonymous Anonymous Operation India members said that they hacked into Reliance’s servers and obtained a list of all government blocked websites, as well as links to sites that have been blocked by Reliance, including links to search results and blogs on a Satish Seth. The speaker also accused the media of maintaining silence and not covering leaks of lists of websites, and accused the ISP of unblocking websites only to block them again. They said that they hacked into BIGCinema, and shared documents with ticket scans, also claimed that they had access to Credit Card information, but chose not to disclose it in order to protect users. AnonOps India has also planned a protest for June 9th 2012, asking citizens to protest these blocks by wearing a mask. In addition, they mentioned that facebook pages of protesting Air India staff had also been blocked.

They shared the following video during the Q&A.

  

  

During the Q&A, the group said that “(Anti) Piracy is just a tool and excuse for them (the Government) to take control over the web, our last medium of free speech”, adding that and that P2P is not a crime and if piracy has to be prevented then specific URLs should be blocked, not entire websites. “VIMEO for example also helps small time film makers make and share content, what explanation is there to denying them their tool,” the moderator said. The group also pointed out that India was the only government to have taken down an Anonyous Twitter page, something which even the US Government had not the done. While accusing the India media for their lack of coverage, calling it “Paid Media”, the group said that they will not take down media sites because “it prevents the people from knowing other information,” and that they will not take down any “public structures”. Reliance was attacked since it was the first to implement the blocks, but, the group warned, that it won’t be the only one.

MediaNama has written to Reliance Communications for a clarification of their policy on blocking of websites, especially whether they block websites beyond that which is mandated by the government or courts.

A transcript of the press conference:  
\[14:31\] Welcome to the first full fledged virtual Press conference we are doing  
\[14:31\] As part of #OpIndia and #Anonmous Collective for Indian Media  
\[14:32\] I apologize for the low speed in which we are communicating, please bear with us.  
\[14:32\] ===================  
\[14:33\] Nearly one week ago the ISP’s of india  
\[14:33\] began blocking sites of different kind, from public access using varied methods  
\[14:34\] We as the anonymous collective decided to protest to this action in our own way.  
\[14:34\] As part of this we entered an ISP’s server and extracted the complete list of blocked sites  
\[14:35\] But what we found was shocking  
\[14:36\] While the blocked sited are very less to the public knowledge and the governments acceptance  
\[14:36\] We found huge number of other sites and url’s blocked  
\[14:37\] as all this happened in the privacy of the ISP’s Servers very few knew about this  
\[14:37\] Or would have known about this.  
\[14:38\] if it was not for the anonymous hackers who got it for the general public.  
\[14:38\] The target ISP was Reliance.  
\[14:38\] And we got the entire list of the blocked sites from them.  
\[14:38\] And guess what it contained.  
\[14:39\] It contained the list of all Government blocked sites.  
\[14:39\] but it contained more too,  
\[14:40\] It contained sites and URL that neither the public not the Government has even heard of.  
\[14:40\] Example is : links linking to search results and blogs on SATISH SETH  
\[14:41\] who was an executive in reliance, for some reason reliance had to block him \[ Of course for PROFIT REASONS\]  
\[14:42\] So as where does this get us at.  
\[14:43\] In india as far as common man is concerned only DOT can block a site. But powers like reliance keep doing it.  
\[14:43\] There is no one to check maybe, Or maybe government has something to do with this (wait before you deny).  
\[14:44\] But then as soon as we released the leaks MEDIA DID NOT cover it for obvious reasons  
\[14:45\] but at times your powerlessness is mostly induced by your own silence.  
\[14:47\] So this gave reliance a chance to remove all the bad smudges and look good suddenly  
\[14:47\] any one noticed how sites were coming back up again.  
\[14:47\] yes they did  
\[14:49\] and as soon as it began to die out, they started blocking it again:  
\[14:49\] but they were idiots to think that we had stopped watching them  
\[14:49\] We went in again and came out with the latest list  
\[14:49\] but again here came the biggest kick:  
\[14:49\] \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Has anyone of you heard of any court order or DOT order blocking the Facebook pages of the Protesting AirIndia Staff.  
\[14:49\] NO you may not have even dreamed about it  
\[14:49\] : yes we found  
\[14:49\] a huge set of URL belonging to persons and Pages in FB that belonged to the Pro Protesters In Indian Airlines  
\[14:50\] And hence we release this leaked list to you===> http://pastehtml.com/view/bz8kycy0o.html  
\[14:50\] This is the list f blocked sites that we leaked from the Reliance servers.  
\[14:51\] For those who want a download version –> http://www.datafilehost.com/download-6f7bc22f.html  
\[14:51\] There it is  
\[14:51\] ==================================  
\[14:52\] Few days ago we had broken into the BIGCinemas website and announced the hack to all  
\[14:52\] But again the media chose to eat up the news  
\[14:52\] But the only people who suffered due to this is the customers and common people  
\[14:53\] Paid media saved thousands from protected advertiser, and the Advertiser made huge from running the site  
\[14:54\] but here people were left in the dark on how badly the companies handle their privacy and secret data.  
\[14:54\] What if we had taken the credit card details and made it public from the site, But we are nothing compared to the hackers who may have already hacked and used the CrediCard data  
\[14:55\] So was the public suppose to be unaware of such a risk and continue to provide prfit for a company  
\[14:55\] if the money so important that peoples safety and protection  
\[14:55\] Very bad idea , very bad idea  
\[14:57\] This file contains the data we leaked from BigCinemas :: IT CONTAINS NO CREID TCARD DETAILS – WE WILL NOT HURT THE PEOPLE : we are doing all this for them  
\[14:57\] http://www.datafilehost.com/download-6bfc5fbb.html  
\[14:58\] The company did not even try to correct the error and continued to run the server as it is,  
\[14:58\] Why should Reliance care if people lost some money thru bad hackers  
\[14:58\] Why?  
\[14:58\] I am concluding by giving you the final link as to the first file we leaked from Reliance  
\[14:59\] The first list that was taken.
