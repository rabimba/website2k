First a little disclaimer.  
I'm a cricket fanatic. Yes I like the sport, I like the tension and of course I simply worship the GOD of cricket..yes Sachin Tendulkar. Back from the times when I used to collect cricket cards (they used to give them with Big Babool,a kind of chewing gum)when I had to fight to defend him against Saurav Ganguly fanboys.  
  
Ok with that little disclaimer. Lets start with this match. Of course this is a high profile high-tension match all has been said and showed about this match in media. We al know about everything there is to know about this match. So like everyone else I too was expecting a terrific match,thats when I was arranging my seat before the TV.  
  
Everything was normal for a while then WHOA!! Sehwag was on fire...what a spell of gul.Sehwag scored 25 in 13 balls...twitter was going abuzz from the twits of my friends..i could barely keep up with the tweets and of course the match but this didn't last long. Soon a lbw and sehwag was back to the dressing room.  
Next came Gambhir. It was ok... because god was still on pitch and was keeping the runrate high enough (7.73 wasn't bad). Then something miraculous happened. A breathtaking moment, when Sachin was declared lbw bi simons and he asked fro review.  
NOw this is something you don't see everyday. A player liek Sachin who walks out of the field in a World Cup match despite the Umpire didn't declare out just because he himself thought he was out don't ask for review just for the sake of it.  
And Bingo!! He was not out!! What a relief. But wait!! The very next ball he is again challenged being stumped? WTF!! What the hell these Pak players are thinking and BAM!! This time too Sachin is not out!!  
  
A collective relief. But this day was only reserved for surprises..nothing else.  
After that the fielders missed 3 of Sachin's Catch??? SACHIN'S CATCH??  
  
Now definitely this is not something you see everyday let alone in a worldcup semifinal. On top of it for a player like Sachin. But wait what about the match?  
Well quite like characteristically Indian team kept chocking. Gambhir out,Yuvrag BOLD in the first ball...and then Sachin is out.  
  
This is normally the moment you go out to have a cup of coffee...but not today...i was going to finish the match. Can't waste my leave.  
SO had to bear the match. And now waiting with clenched fist to wait for pakistan to bat and waiting for Indian bowlers to bowl them out. Normally I wouldn't bet high on it but no option today.  
  
This post is purely my own attempt to relive some of the tension I'm experiencing now.  
Hope it will work.  
  
BLEED BLUE India!!!  
  
Will finish it off with a second post only if India wins tonight..
