How many of you have noticed weird behavior of some of our most visited websites?  
Have you noticed that the Wikipedia page today looks like this

What is this?  
This is a all-out Blackout. Why?  
Because of SOPA. What is SOPA? Read about it here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop\_Online\_Piracy\_Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act)  
Today's blackout is akin to a "sit-in" protest. It is extreme but non-violent and non-threatening and once the point is made the players will move on to other forms of protest. Google has blacked out its logo on its homepage, Wikipedia is denying (top picture) access to entries and Reddit is giving facts about SOPA and what you can do to stop it. What does a blacked out Internet look like? Take a look at the screenshot below.
