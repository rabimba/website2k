As I promised this is my second post as India finally won the match.And talking about match..what a match it was. Just before I delve into that precious glorious excitement that "kick" of yesterday let me narrate from a little blog on yahoo.  
The title was "It is just another game". There in his phrase.  
  
  

> It's just another game.No, seriously. It is.Yes, there is a World Cup final berth at stake -- but two teams played yesterday for the same stakes, with no one pretending that the fate of the world hung in the balance (in fact, television channels were banging on about today's game while yesterday's was see-sawing through its course).Today, two other teams are playing for the second berth -- and that is all they are doing.

  
  
But...oh well..It _was not just another match_. India-Pakistan can never be just another match. And the impact they have in the people of both countries..well **UNBELIEVABLE**.  
  
  
First a little bit to sum up the story I left. When I again sat for the Pakistan innings (with a vow that whatever happens I will not curse,not in my room not in twitter/fb) they were running steady. Their calculative batting payed well till 9th over when Akmal went to pavilion giving a little peace to my mind. From there on it was like that...they start scoring and when someone reaches a dangerous point...BANG!! he is out :P  
  
  
It was a nice feeling and on top came the Sehwag blitz. He really took revenge for dismissing him in the first ball. And what a sweet revenge it was. From then on, it was almost mathematical: shut them down and take them out. And it went just like that.  
  
  
But there was another story going on side by side. There were sound of crackers with every wicket, people shouting at the top of their voice. And the streets....I've NEVER seen them as empty even in a BHARAT BANDH. Still in doubt about the passion India..specially kolkata and west bengal yields for Cricket?  
  
  
And when the last wicket fell....well I still can hear the collective uproar. Twitter and fb was going crazy with buzz upon buzz (ok twitter beat it all) and phones started ringing like hell.  
  
  
The very first call I received was from Samrat Sanyal..what he said in the phone isn;t something to write here but the meaning was clear :D We've beat the shit out of them. And thus continued the phone saga for sometime. Received a call from Dhruba kaku too,it was more controlled (if you can call a lecturer going out in streets to see and feel the euphoria) :)  
  
  
Rallies,bike brigades roaming in the streets with triclour bands shouting on top of their voice...all these continued last night.  
  
  
And all these again made me realize how connected we are to this game. How we feel for this game. And how a game can change us.  
  
  
And now to finish this post...allow me to introduce a little incentive that the Indian team is going to get after they win this match :D
