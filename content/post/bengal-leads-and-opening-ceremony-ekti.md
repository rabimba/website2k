This post is unlike my other posts.  
I'll strictly talk about an event here (and try to be imperative to what I feel about it).  
  
Some of us have heard of an event called Bengal Leads in the past few days. It is a Govt. Of West Bengal initiative for a portrait of what our state has to offer to the the investors, both foreign and domestic.  
According to it's own website  

> The Government of West Bengal is organising, for the first time an exhibition cum business summit - Bengal Leads 2012, where the State will exhibit its areas of strength and opportunities in varied sectors and facilitate interaction amongst all stakeholders.

The website looks nice and clean (-minus a few glitches and only 5 security vulnerabilities) unlike most of the Govt. sites I have visited. The Crowsnest have done a good job with the site, just didn't understand the unsymmetrical foter image background is a intentional effect or just carelessness.  
You can visit the site here --> [http://www.bengalleads.com/index.html](http://www.bengalleads.com/index.html)  
As you can see it even starts with a welcome note from the CM so it is quite safe to assume she has quite a say in this matter and perhaps one of the initiators of this business summit.  
Now without further ado I would like you to please see the below video which is her opening speech on the starting day (9th) and the purpose of this blog post.  
  
Watch this video(be patient till the end please,I'm sure you'll enjoy it) and then please do comment your views :)  
I'm sure you will have plenty to say :)
