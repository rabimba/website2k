For onething Silchar has kept me handful, is its breathtaking beauty. Being a Siliguri boy, mountains are nothing new to me. But the nature of mountains here are a little different than the Himalayn range. For instance, the house from where I'm bloffing this is built on such a small pick(or rather platue).  
The place where I snapped this pic is called Sidhheswari Mandir. Near the Assam University. There aren't many places to visit nearby, so masu and jethu told we should visit this as it has a very nice surroundings. Mom and masu went in the Allto and me,dad and jethu went into the Indigo. Well quite a luxury car that was.  
After we reached there was nothing to see, except this...Well the surroundings were really nice. But it was almost dawn so none of my pics came quite to my liking except this one.  
  
If only this place had a little rain and been a little cooler...
