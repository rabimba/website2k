[GAudi](http://labs.google.com/gaudi) is short for **Google Audio Indexin**g, and it’s the latest experiment to be added to the [Google Labs](http://labs.google.com/). This service lets you do a text search for spoken words in videos of YouTube’s US politicians channels. The functionality was previously already available as part of [an iGoogle gadget](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-07-15-n73.html).

Will Google ever manage to apply this technology to all YouTube videos – and perhaps even videos not contained on YouTube, but available from other video upload platforms? Google in their FAQ write that the aim of GAudi “on Google Labs is broader and the US election is just a first step. We see it as an experiment platform where we can learn what features make the best user experience for people looking for spoken content on the Web.” ![](http://www.google.com/images/nav_logo3.png "Google")
