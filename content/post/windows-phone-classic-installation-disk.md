Th dreaded message that suggest us maybe it;'s time fro a format.  
  
And this makes it's legendary return in Windows Phone!!!

So what do you think?  
  
On your way to buying one? (Windows Phone that is).  
Chances are you won't be facing this issue (Yes, it has been confirmed to appear only if you unlock the device for development and do some unnecessary tinkering).  
  
but still it is hilarious don't you think?
