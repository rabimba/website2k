My time in home is almost up for my this trip.

And everytime I leave this town,the same emotions swell inside me. The same story unfolds itself....everytime.

Wonder when I'll be out of this Âµ-ish trance....anyway.

Changed the layout of this blog yesterday. And I'm thinking whether to keep rolling in this blogger post or whether to shift up to my own wordpress. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages.

Anyway will figure it out later.

And maybe i'll create a different and more formal blog for my technical posts. I _think_ i'd like to keep my technical part and my sluggish lazy part apart :)

  

Maybe this will later turn out to be informal _public_ diary :D

Who knows.

  

Anyway have to get up now. Maybe will post again at night. HAve lot to do now. And a technical article is also due to be posted.
