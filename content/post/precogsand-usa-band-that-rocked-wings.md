I know this post comes a bit late but better late than never.  
So first off an introduction...what is Pre-cogs? Pre-cogs is a band that originated from the Cognizant Academy Kolkata. The idea of the band was first drafted after the announcement of Wings, the cultural in-house talent showcase of Cognizant. The 30th dec joiners’ of our first combined batch mainly Samrat,Shalini,Sandipto and Siddharth first came up with the idea of the band. Along with Rajesh and Dinantika being their support. The first hurdle for them was to find a good bassist and drummer. Though Sandy is an all-rounder it wasn't the solution because he'll be in the guitar. This was solved by our next batch of joiners’. Turjo became the drummer and Tanmoy became the bassist. And thus Pre-cogs was born.  
  
  
These people fought hard to keep this band together, utilizing as much time as they can squeeze between their academy sessions and sometimes sacrificing CS for it :P (Listening n0tti and 7khoon maaf?) And jamming on Sundays and Saturdays. But nevertheless the outcome was awesome.  
  
  
Their first performance was on the day of wings (i.e. refer to my other blog post on wings). And we were more than excited to cheer for the band that first originated from our own batch and form our friends. What happened in the show is not something you should read from a lazy blogger like me.  
  
  
They spun out tracks like Zombie (cranberry),Pink floyd,Kokhon tomar asbe telephone (Mohiner ghoraguli) and many more which I can't and shouldn't describe in this lousy manner. I've uploaded the first part of the video I shot there. Just visit YouTube and listen to them to get the feel.  

  
  
Sandy and Tanmoy were AWEsome in guitar, and I never imagined the versatility of Sam's voice. Shalini complimented him perfectly and in her solo well...you have to listen to it to get what I mean. They were a perfect pair (in the stage of course :P) The atmosphere was electrifying out there and we all were grooving to their tunes. For an hour we almost forgot that we were in the GTP bantala sitting with CTS heads. We just rocked with their performance.  
  
  
I'm getting a bit emotional while writing this as we have been told that we will be leaving our academy on 1st march...and it's quite obvious to all of us that we'll get separated after we get assigned to BU.  
But these feelings these memories are never gonna fade and this blog post is going to ensure that it doesn't.  
So if anyone reading this post has had a similar experience please share it with us.  
  
  
I'll be more than happy to have some like minded comments.  
  
  
\*\* A little more update: Dinantika is cadaverously shaking her head saying that she was there with the band at every jamming session and every practice and why didn't I mention her :P Sorry Dina, forgot it completely :P \*\*
