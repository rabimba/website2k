My last blog post was more than a year ago.  
A lot has changed since then and a prominent change among it is the fact that I'm no longer a student.  
This may quite be my deciding post here, I always wondered where my blog will lead,a technical or a non-technical one. And today I'm quite sure its going to be a non-technical one.  
Though hopefully tonight I'll start my own blog in my own TLD with a host of other things I've always planned but never got the urge or resources to execute.  
  
I love google and in that sense blogpost too so this will still be my web-log of the mundane things I'll be compelled to do from now on.  
  
The C3 protected tag may instigate many of you. And i'm sure if you just google it you'll find the relevance.  
  
Blogging was always more of a side hobby and now it'll be a part time compulsion too.  
Hope I'll enjoy that.  
  
Hope my next post will be from Kolkata itself, not some god forsaken place.
