So this new year instead of making all those "Promises" I'm gonna start this new blog. :)  
Well The idea has been around for quite some time. But I really didn't had enough time and more importantly the enthusiasm to get through it.  
But...Looks like it had to start :D  
So here I am.  
  
I'm not quite sure whether I'll be able to maintain this blog as a diary of all my thoughts and ramblings or will this become a junkyard of all my "technical" rants.  
But then again...we shall see :)  
  
So next is my first technical post :0
