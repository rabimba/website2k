I will be conducting a workshop on Advanced Python Programming on University Of Texas at Dallas on November 17th. Everyone is invited to participate.  
  
Registrations are taken at [UTD Marketplace](http://bit.ly/ccutd).  
You can directly register for the event at [here](https://ezpay.utdallas.edu/C20239_ustores/web/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCTID=1153).  
  
This workshop will assume your familiarity with Python and Model View Controller architecture. I will be covering high level introductions and some basic concepts with a very popular python framework named Django. The session will be mostly a hands on where we will be building a dynamic scalable web app using python and Django. At the end of the session participants should have with them their first app.  
  
**Recommended Pre-Requisites:** It is recommended for the participants to have the following skillset to take full advantage of the session  
  

*   Familiarity with python (Participants are encouraged to attend the [basic](http://www.utdallas.edu/k12/desc/#python) level session first)
*   Knowledge about [MVC ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)architecture
*   Knowledge about basic HTML,Javascript and how web works
*   Knowledge about GIT and databases would be a plus

It  will take place at Classroom [ECSS 2.415](http://www.utdallas.edu/locator/?externalKey=LocECSS_2.415)
