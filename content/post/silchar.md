So yesterday I reached Silchar.  

Actually I'm in assam university. Residing in a VC's house is quite amusing. One of the advantages of being here is that at this moment I'm blogging :) And Encoding "Bombai er bombete"

  

Its quite enjoyable here. Except the fact that I really didn't expect it to be so much hot here. Really, for heavens sake, isn't Shilchar supposed to be a lot more cooler. I mean come on...I know Guwahati is hot (unlike the girls I've seen there so far,except a few though) but Shilchar too??

  

And what a journey it was from the Airport.

The Shilchar airport (if it can be called airport) is a small aerodrome. And the Assam University is alomst 48kms away from the Airport!!!

Even Shilchar is 22kms from it (even then the A.U is almost 26kms from the town). Nothing to say much about Silchar. No fantasies there. Just a di

rty little town crowded with people just like Siliguri and Kolkata.

  

But this place,where I am now is so much different. It's quite...as a mouse :)

  

Yesterday me,dad,mom,masu(still use that name) and jethu went to see the University.

Watched the newly constructed buldings and rods. I clicked a few snaps. Wil upload them later. Then left for a local mandap and finally back to home.

  

Here is a snap of our little gtahering at the house.
