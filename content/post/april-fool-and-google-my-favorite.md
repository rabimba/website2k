Google has done it _yet_ again.  

  

Today is April 1st, the day where you fol everyone. And also the day everyone pulls their pranks on you.

And among that _everyone_ in your virtual life one of my most favourite parnks puller is Google.

  

And just as I fired up my Lappy today i couldn't help but noticing their hilarious but ingenious pranks.

Now the very First one is 8bit Google Maps, also being told as

  

Google Maps Quest
=================

  

  

The above is their official video.

In a post in Google Plus they say about it as follows 

> Today +[Google Maps](https://plus.google.com/111401917971052287374) announced Google Maps 8-bit for NES. With[#8bitmaps](https://plus.google.com/s/%238bitmaps), you can do everything you'd normally do in Maps—search for famous landmarks and sites around the world, get directions and even use Street View.

Just in time for April Fool's Day, Google has introduced Google Maps Quest, a retro 8-bit version of its mapping tool that is... totally awesome.  
  
In a characteristically whimsical video, available above, Google employees introduce the new version for the [Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System), replete with finicky cartridge and 8-bit music.  

> "With Google Maps 8-bit, you can do all the things you already do on regular Google Maps," writes Tatsuo Nomura, a Google software engineer, [in a post on Google's official Maps blog](http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2012/03/begin-your-quest-with-google-maps-8-bit.html). "Search for famous landmarks and sites around the world. Take an epic journey with 8-bit Street View. Get detailed directions to avoid dangerous paths, and battle your way through a world of powerful monsters and mystic treasures."

To use Quest (from your computer, of course), [head over to Google Maps](http://www.maps.google.com/) and simply click the "Quest" box in the top right corner. Then, you're whisked away to 8-bit land of maps. Be sure to try Street View in Quest mode.  
Apart from this the another one I noticed is  
  
  

Chrome Multitask mode
=====================

  

This is another masterpiece from Google.

According to their official blog which you can read here

  

> Multitask Mode lets you have access to multiple mice at the same time, so you can make a chess move while you watch a dance move, or draw a horse while you draw on a friend for relationship advice.  
> Chrome can handle as many mice, touchpads, styli, joysticks, trackballs, and other pointing devices as you can plug into your computer, so you and your friends can browse dozens of sites at the same time.

  

  
And whats more amazing is that they also have the toy so that you can play with it :P  
  
Just head over to [http://google.com/chrome/multitask](http://google.com/chrome/multitask) and play with it :)  
  
Then comes the fabled  
  
  

Google Racing
=============

  

In their own words

  

> We spend a lot of time at Google trying to answer "What ifs?" What if you could find any info you need, the instant you need it? Google Search. What if you could view some of the world’s most renowned art online? _The Art Project_. And what if you built a self-driving car capable of navigating a track at speeds upwards of 200mph while surrounded by other cars? Our answer to that last one is Google Racing, a partnership with NASCAR to design and build autonomous stock cars. Find out more at [google.com/racing](http://google.com/racing).

  
They really outdid on this one. Head over to the [website](http://www.google.com/racing/) to gain more insight.  
  
And the last one I _almost _missed  
  
  

The Youtube Collection
======================

  

The title explains it all. I don't need to re-iterate it. Just head over to the video uploaded to the Official Youtube channel.

  
  

  

  
  
Now this is just the beginning of the day. I am quite sure they have more such pranks up their sleeves.  
I'll cover them all once I start discovering them.
